# Flying with allergies

## Who this is for

If you have a severe allergy, **especially** an airborne/contact allergy to nuts, peanuts, or seeds, you should read this.

Even if your allergy is not airborne, it is absolutely OK to take measures to protect yourself and feel safe. Being enclosed in a small space with dozens of people eating something you're fatally allergic to can be really scary, especially if it's something you've never done before. With a little preparation, your flight doesn't have to be that way.

## What conference organizers should know

If you are booking flights for speakers with severe allergies (especially to nuts, peanuts, or seeds), keep in mind that those speakers may need to book with specific airlines that have satisfactory allergy policies in order to feel safe. Many airlines do not.

If speakers are traveling internationally, consider covering the cost of emergency medical travel insurance for them. Keep in mind that new speakers/speakers who have never traveled out of country may be unaware of the risks and medical costs associated with an accidental allergic reaction in your country.

## Insurance

If your employer or credit card doesn't already provide emergency medical travel insurance and you're flying internationally, make sure you purchase insurance yourself. It's easy, cheap, and could save you literally *thouands* of dollars if you have an allergic reaction while you're away.

### For Canadians

I recommend buying RBC's [Classic Medical Plan Single Trip or Multi-Trip Annual Coverage](http://www.rbcinsurance.com/travelinsurance/classic-medical-plan.html). You can purchase it online and it only costs about $38 for a single trip, or $66 dollars for a whole year (depending on your age and the length of the trip). It will cover accidental allergic reactions, as long as you are in a "stable" medical condition 90 days before departure.

## General safety measures

* Talk to your doctor about whether you should travel at all, especially if you have airborne allergies
* Bring your own epi-pens and other medication on board (if you have a life-threatening allergy, you should **always** do this)
* Don't trust airline food. Bring your own food on board, or eat before/after you land.
* Even if you've called ahead, always inform the airline staff at the gate or when you board of your allergy

## What can airlines do for you?

* Some airlines will allow you (or a friend) to pre-board in order to wipe down your seat and surrounding area to make sure you don't accidentally come in contact with the allergen. This is  important if you have contact-based allergies
* Request a buffer zone: this is when the flight attendants inform people in the rows (usually 2) in front and behind you to refrain from consuming/opening (X) and they won't serve (X) for the duration of the flight. Some airlines will do this for the whole plane, usually on shorter flights/smaller planes.
* Some airlines have a policy not to serve peanuts/nuts. Keep in mind that a) this might apply to peanuts but not nuts and vice versa, and b) that passengers might have their own food, so you might want to request a buffer zone as well

## The Reality

* Many airlines still serve tree nuts (e.g. mixed nuts, almonds) and peanuts on board
* Some airlines offer a buffer zone, but many specifically state in their policies they do not
* Airline staff have varying degrees of compliance and understanding about severe allergies. For example, I have found that when calling airlines, **many people do not understand the difference between a tree nut and a peanut allergy**. e.g. even after explaining in detail what tree nuts you are allergic to, in might still be recorded as a peanut allergy

## Some common North American airlines

### Canada

* [Air Canada](http://www.aircanada.com/en/travelinfo/onboard/dining/nutritional.html) does not serve peanuts, but some flights do serve food containing tree nuts. If you call ahead they will provide a buffer zone and clean your seat/surrounding areas. They also have a policy related to severe pet allergies.
* [WestJet](https://www.westjet.com/guest/en/travel/special-arrangements/special-needs/allergies.shtml) does not serve nuts or peanuts on board. They stock epi-pens, will create a buffer zone for you, and will make an announcement asking passengers not to eat nuts or peanuts.

### US
* [United Airlines](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/specialneeds/needs/peanut-allergies.aspx) says they don't serve peanuts on board but they **do not offer nut-free buffer zones** to customers. It's unclear whether they still serve tree nuts.
* [American Airlines](https://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/specialAssistance/allergies-meds-meals.jsp) does not serve peanuts but **they do serve tree nuts on board**. They **do not provide buffer zones or allow pre-boarding** for customers with severe allergies.
* [Delta Airlines](http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/agency/useful-resources/peanut-allergy-policy.html) will refrain from serving peanut products on board and allow customers to pre-board in order to clean seats if you call ahead/inform flight attendants at the gate. There is no mention of tree nuts here.
* [Alaska Airlines](http://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/accessible-services/specialservices-other.aspx) says their food may contain nuts, and allows pre-boarding.
* [Virgin America](https://www.virginamerica.com/) doesn't seem to have a policy available anywhere online, although I've never flown virgin so I'm not sure about this one.
